// ============ ridge / slope lift: a deterministic field from terrain × wind ============
// Unlike thermals (which we must detect from circling probes), slope lift is just wind
// deflected by the ground, so we can PREDICT it from the DEM and the wind — everywhere,
// with or without traffic. The terrain-forced vertical air velocity is
//   w = wind · ∇terrain            (positive where the wind blows uphill)
// refined by two effects: higher ground upwind shelters a cell (less lift in the lee),
// and on a sunny day the heated slopes drive an up-slope (anabatic) flow that lifts even
// when the synoptic wind is calm. Rough and illustrative (see docs) — but a *value*: no
// renderer, no app state, no network.
